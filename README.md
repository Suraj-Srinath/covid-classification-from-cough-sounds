Patients suffering form COVID-19 may develop changes in voice and distinguishable voice signatures because of the 
respiratory problems caused by the virus.

Since vocal biomarkers have previously been successful in the identification and monitoring 
of several disorders, it suggests that it may be able to detect COVID 19 using vocal sounds.

Although Real-time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is the gold 
standard for Covid-19 test, it is time-consuming and requires an in-person visit. This project is just an attempt to build a model which could act as a screening step before investing expensive and time-consuming definitive steps.
